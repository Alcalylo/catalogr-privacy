<h1>Privacy Policy – Catalogr</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 19, 2026<br>
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 21, 2026</p>

<p>
Catalogr is a personal inventory and records management application designed
to help users catalog belongings, documents, photos, and emergency-related information.
We are committed to protecting your data and maintaining transparency about how it is handled.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Email address for account creation and authentication</li>
  <li>User-generated content including item details, notes, documents, photos, and videos</li>
  <li>An internal user ID used to associate data with your account</li>
</ul>

<p>
Catalogr does not collect location data, device fingerprinting data,
behavioral tracking data, or advertising identifiers.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<p>Your data is used solely to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authenticate and manage your account</li>
  <li>Store and retrieve your inventory and uploaded content</li>
  <li>Provide core application functionality</li>
  <li>Maintain system security and integrity</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not use your content for advertising, profiling, or AI model training.
</p>

<h2>Data Storage & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
Catalogr stores structured data (such as item metadata and account information)
in a managed PostgreSQL database. Uploaded files (photos, documents, videos)
are stored separately in secure mounted storage.
</p>

<p>
All network communication is encrypted using HTTPS.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention & Account Deletion</h2>
<p>
You may delete your account at any time within the app.
When an account is deleted:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>All associated database records are permanently removed</li>
  <li>All associated uploaded files are permanently deleted</li>
  <li>Deletion is irreversible</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not retain user content after account deletion beyond routine short-term
infrastructure backups required for service stability.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
Catalogr does not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties.
We do not provide user data to advertisers.
</p>

<p>
We may disclose information only if required by law or valid legal process.
</p>

<h2>Tracking & Analytics</h2>
<p>
Catalogr does not use third-party analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks,
or behavioral tracking systems.
</p>

<h2>User Responsibility</h2>
<p>
Users retain full ownership of the content they upload.
By using Catalogr, you affirm that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have the legal right to upload the content you provide</li>
  <li>The content does not violate applicable laws</li>
  <li>The content does not infringe on third-party rights</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>
We implement industry-standard security practices including encrypted communication,
authentication controls, and secure server infrastructure.
No system can guarantee absolute security, but we take reasonable measures
to protect user data.
</p>
